CPP_Sockets
        Comprises network programming code using traditional sockets in C/C++.

        Build the code by running the make command. To run the built executables,
        open two shells. In one shell, run the server code. Make a note of the
        port number on which the server is going to run. In another shell, run the
        client executable. It will ask for the server's port and IP address. If
        running on the same machine, the IP address of server will be 127.0.0.1.
