This is the top-level folder comprising sample/scaffolding code for various
packages/frameworks that are needed in systems courses that I teach, such as
Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Computer Networks.

Directories so far:

SocketProgramming
        Shows network programming using socket-level programming. Here, we show
        both traditional and ZeroMQ sockets.

Serialization
        Here we show some serialization frameworks on user-defined message formats.
