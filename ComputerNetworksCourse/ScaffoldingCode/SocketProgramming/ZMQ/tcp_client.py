# Sample code for CS4283-5283
# Vanderbilt University
# Instructor: Aniruddha Gokhale
# Created: Fall 2022
# 
# Code taken from ZeroMQ's sample code for the HelloWorld
# program, but modified to use REQ-REP sockets to showcase
# TCP. Plus, added other decorations like comments, print statements,
# argument parsing, etc.
#
# ZMQ is also offering a new CLIENT-SERVER pair of ZMQ sockets but
# these are still in draft form and are not properly supported. If you
# want to try, just replace REQ by CLIENT here (and correspondingly, in
# the tcp_server.py, replace REP by SERVER)
#
# Note: my default indentation is now set to 2 (in other snippets, it
# used to be 4)

# import the needed packages
import sys    # for system exception
import time   # for sleep
import argparse # for argument parsing
import zmq    # this package must be imported for ZMQ to work
